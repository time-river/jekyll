# light
---
A jekyll theme based in [Google Material Design Lite](http://www.getmdl.io/index.html).

很久之前创作的 Jekyll 主题，已经弃用~

## Demo
---
## Getting Started

clone repository
```
git clnoe https://github.com/time-river/light.git
```
that's OK, yet no other libraries needed.

## Post Options

Tow options need to be paid attention to. `categories` and `tags`. A normal post options should like this:  
```
---
layout: post
categories: style
tags: demo
image: <address>
---
```
`post` means to use template named post.  
`categories`, has two values, `style` and `local_movies`. One passage has one unique categories' name. If you write a passage about living, I suggest it's categories named local_movies rather than style.  
`tags` is not unique in a passage.  
`image` just exists in a passages which categories is `local_movies`.
