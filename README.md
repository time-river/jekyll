## Demo

## Getting Started

clone repository
```
git clnoe https://github.com/time-river/light.git

## Post Options

Tow options need to be paid attention to. `categories` and `tags`. A normal post options should like this:

`post` means to use template named post.  
`categories`, has two values, `style` and `local_movies`. One passage has one unique categories' name. If you write a passage about living, I suggest it's categories named local_movies rather than style.  
`tags` is not unique in a passage.  
`image` just exists in a passages which categories is `local_movies`. 

of course, there're other options supported in jekyll, such as
